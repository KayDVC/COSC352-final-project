## Overview
This is my implementation of [project from a course](https://github.com/compsage/MSU_COSC352/tree/main/projects/3) taught by a [coworker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-white-bb0b174a/). 

## Objective

[See here.](https://github.com/compsage/MSU_COSC352/blob/main/projects/3/Readme.md) I chose Zig as my programming language because it's a language I've never used, but hear about all the time. 

## Use 

This project is not intended to be used as a template or guide, but it can definitely can be used as "inspiration." Please link back to [this repo](https://github.com/KayDVC/semmed-neo4j) or [my website](https://www.malakaispann.com) if you do.

Thanks,
